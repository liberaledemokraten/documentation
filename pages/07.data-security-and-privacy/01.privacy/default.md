Privacy is among the core elements of our digitalization concept. As a social-liberal party, it is important for us to enable means of the members and visitors being in control of their data. Especially, it is one of our main concerns to ensure that we do not unnecessarily share data with third parties. To that end, a few ground rules will be explained here.

The legal base of the articles will be the EU-GDPR regulation ("DSGVO" in German). Any regulations and laws other than EU and German ones are not considered here.
