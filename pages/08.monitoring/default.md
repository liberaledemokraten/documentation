title: Monitoring
---

There will be components and settings, we may want to monitor for either security reasons or to ensure access and availability. One of the main challenges of managing an own server however is that this monitoring is highly time-consuming, so we need to automatize things. We'll make good use of some available monitoring platforms to that end. For ease of use, most of the methods will send email notifications when an event occurs.

!!!! You should at best create an email address reserved for receiving such email alerts.
