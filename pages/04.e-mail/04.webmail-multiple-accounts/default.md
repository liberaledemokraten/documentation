title: 'Webmail: Multiple Accounts'
---

You may want to manage multiple e-mail accounts within a single interface. However, you might not want to log into each of them manually, but log into your personal account and access the other mailboxes from there. Luckily for us, there are many plugins for Roundcube available, one of which addresses this issue. The plugin can be found in BitBucket [BoresExpress/ident_switch](https://bitbucket.org/BoresExpress/ident_switch/src/master/).
