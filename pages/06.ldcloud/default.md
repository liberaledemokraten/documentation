LD Cloud is the Cloud infrastructure of the Liberale Demokraten in Germany. It is based on Nextcloud. There are two main rules while maintaining the LD Cloud:

* Never modify any Nextcloud (sub-)directory and its content by yourself. If you want to add anything, add it outside and set up the web server to respond to the specific paths
* If you utilize a CDN, always synchronize the non-user static files with your CDN once you install or update any plugin or the cloud software

The following articles describe some customizations of the LD Cloud. While maintaining the LD Cloud, those custom elements should be kept in mind.
