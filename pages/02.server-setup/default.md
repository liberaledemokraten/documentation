Firstly, install your desired OS. While doing so, you should configure that the root user can login via SSH exclusively using an SSH key and not by using a password. Thenafter, go through the [Vesta CP](/vestacp) article. Now, you have a server and a platform to manage it.

## Softaculous
You can use Softacoulos' one step easy installation system to install the most common softwares there are. The premium option costs about $10 per year, but it's definitely worth it as one saves alot of time by automatizing the installation process and making it easy to install software for any of the local branches. You can even quickly install Nextcloud through Softaculous.
